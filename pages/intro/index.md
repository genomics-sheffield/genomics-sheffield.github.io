These pages introduce the Sheffield Genomics facility

## Testimonials

> “A one-stop shop for all your molecular needs! The genomics facility is extremely well equipped and the in-house team has a wealth of experience meaning they can offer expert advice on all aspects from experimental design to bioinformatic analysis. The facility is an integral part of my research, and has helped me get the most out of our budget and data.” 

* Dr Luke Dunning -  School of Biosciences

> The genomics laboratory has been instrumental in assisting my group in adopting and utilizing various genotyping platforms. They have provided comprehensive training, helped with managing plate runs, and actively assisted in data retrieval, analysis, and interpretation. Thanks to their expertise, this technique has become an integral part of our laboratory's routine for genotyping zebrafish CRISPR mutant lines. I am truly grateful to the genomics laboratory for the continuous technical support at such a high level.

> Having an in-house genomics laboratory equipped with Oxford Nanopore technology has been immensely beneficial for my PhD. The flexibility and transparency demonstrated by the lab have been invaluable, as they have provided me with real-time updates on sequencing runs. Moreover, they have gone above and beyond to offer demonstrations upon request. Their support and insights have played a vital role in generating high-quality DNA methylation sequencing data from my Arabidopsis plants.
