# Single Cell Immune Profiling , Single Cell Gene Expression, Cell analysis 


## 10x Chromium iX 

The 10x system allows automated sample partitioning on small beads, where each sample particle is linked with a unique barcode prior to library preparation. This system makes gene expression, chromatin accessibility, immune profiling and other analyses possible at single cell resolution
 
## 10x Genomics Chromium Controller

Uses advanced microfluidics to perform single-cell partitioning and barcoding in a matter of minutes by using Next GEM technology
Enables integrated analysis of single cells at a massive scale.
Single Cell Gene Expression profiling, Immune Profiling, ATAC sequencing or Multi-omic profiling.
