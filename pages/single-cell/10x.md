<tr><td>The 10x system allows automated sample partitioning on small beads, where each sample particle is linked with a unique barcode prior to library preparation. This system makes gene expression, chromatin accessibility, immune profiling and other analyses possible at single cell resolution</td>
<td>Uses advanced microfluidics to perform single-cell partitioning and barcoding in a matter of minutes by using Next GEM technology; Enabling integrated analysis of single cells at a massive scale.</td>
