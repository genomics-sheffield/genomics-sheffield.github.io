The nanoString nCounter® SPRINT profiler integrates sample preparation and analysis into a single instrument, allowing the analysis of up to 800 RNA targets simultaneously using single-tube multiplexing. It can detect both RNA and DNA from a variety of sample types, including tissue (either fresh, frozen or FFPE preserved). The nanoString nCounter technology additionally benefits from low input requirements (50-150 ng RNA and 5-300 ng DNA) without the need for reverse transcription or amplification.

# Description

Nucleic acid targets are directly labelled through hybridisation with single target-specific molecular barcodes (colour-coded probes).

Probe-nucleic acid hybridisations are purified, immobilised and aligned on a nCounter cartridge and the barcodes counted. 

The probe set panels can either be [pre-designed](https://nanostring.com/products/ncounter-assays-panels/panel-selection-tool/) or custom-made using nanoString's [design service](https://nanostring.com/products/ncounter-assays-panels/ncounter-custom-solutions/).

Data from the nCounter SPRINT Profiler can be directly imported into the freely available [nSolver software](https://nanostring.com/products/analysis-solutions/ncounter-analysis-solutions/) for analysis.
