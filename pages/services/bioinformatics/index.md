We recommend contacting the Bioinformatics Core in advance if you are planning a high-throughput experiment. To paraphrase the statistician R.A. Fisher.

> "Consulting a statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely asking them to conduct a post-mortem examination. They may be able to say what the experiment died of."
