You can access the most popular forms of sequencing technology via Genomics services here at Sheffield. We have equipment available on-site, or we can outsource to a commerical vendor is this is more suitable.

Choosing between short-read and long-read sequencing depends on the specific goals of your omics project. Here's a breakdown of their strengths and weaknesses to help you decide:

Short-read sequencing is typically used for:

- SNP detection and variant calling
- Gene expression analysis (RNA-seq) with high depth
- Targeted resequencing of specific regions
- Projects requiring high accuracy and cost-effectiveness


Long-read sequencing is recommended for:

- De novo genome assembly, especially for complex genomes
- Identifying large insertions, deletions, and rearrangements
- Analyzing repetitive regions of the genome
- Projects requiring complete coverage, even if accuracy is slightly lower

In some cases, combining both technologies can be advantageous. Short-read data can provide high accuracy and depth for core analysis, while long-read data can be used to fill in gaps and resolve complex regions.

Ultimately, the best choice depends on your specific research question and budget. Discussing your project needs with potential NGS facilities can help you determine the most suitable sequencing technology.

## Short-Read Sequencing

- [Find out more](/services/sequencing/short_read)

### Strengths:

- High Accuracy: Short-read sequencing offers very high base calling accuracy (>99.9%).
- High Throughput: It can generate a large volume of sequencing data quickly and efficiently, making it ideal for projects requiring deep coverage of specific regions.
- Lower Cost: Short-read sequencing is generally less expensive than long-read sequencing.
- Wide Applications: It's suitable for various applications like SNP detection, gene expression analysis (RNA-seq), and targeted resequencing.

### Weaknesses:

- Short Read Length: Short reads (typically 50-300 bases) can make it challenging to assemble complex genomes or resolve repetitive regions.
- Gaps in Coverage: Short reads might not provide complete coverage across the entire genome, leading to potential information gaps.

## Long-Read Sequencing

- [Find out more](/services/sequencing/long_read)

### Strengths:

- Long Read Length: Long reads can span thousands of bases, enabling researchers to assemble complex genomes, identify large insertions/deletions, and analyze repetitive regions.
- Complete Coverage: Long reads offer a higher chance of capturing the entire genome sequence with minimal gaps.

### Weaknesses:

- Lower Accuracy: While accuracy is improving, long-read sequencing may have a slightly higher error rate compared to short-read sequencing.
- Lower Throughput: It generates less data volume compared to short-read sequencing, making it less suitable for projects requiring deep coverage.
- Higher Cost: Long-read sequencing can be more expensive than short-read sequencing.
