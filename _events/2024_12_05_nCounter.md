Join us at Sheffield University to dive deep into the nCounterR Analysis System. This reliable gene expression platform allows for multiplexing up to 800 targets using direct detection technology. With a straightforward workflow that requires just 15 minutes of hands-on time for most panels, and an automated benchtop system, you can expect highly reproducible data in less than 24 hours. 

- Robust performance on difficult sample types including FFPE, blood, and biofluids. 
- Accelerated turn-around times shorten time to market and/or publication. 
- Technical reproducibility on low quality RNA including FFPE and non-tissue samples. 
- Extensive menu of ready-to-ship panels designed with input from industry leading experts in the field 

Programme 

- 11:30  Introduction to nCounter - Digital Gene Expression for Translational Research, James Freimuller, Bruker Spatial Biology 
- 11:50 Q&A and Closing Remarks 
- 12:00  Lunch & Networking followed by pre-booked project consultations 

Come discover why this technology has been featured in more than 7,000 peer- reviewed publications.
